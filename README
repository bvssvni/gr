Group Oriented Programming (GOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on decisions and operations on groups, the context, circumstances around a situation rather than the single object, event or message. The basic building block "group" must implemented the Boolean operators AND, OR, EXCEPT.

In this library I focus on "bitstream" format or "array of slices" and raw binary format.
